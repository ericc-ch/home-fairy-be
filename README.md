# Fairy (at Home)

This project requires my API wrapper around edge-tts for Python

So the requirements are:

- [Deno](https://deno.com)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Google AI](https://aistudio.google.com) API Key

Credits:

- Thanks to [npocmaka](https://github.com/npocmaka/batch.scripts) for the screen capture batch script
- Thanks to [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org) so I can easily screenshot from the terminal in Linux
